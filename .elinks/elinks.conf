## ELinks 0.13.GIT configuration file

## This is ELinks configuration file. You can edit it manually,
## if you wish so; this file is edited by ELinks when you save
## options through UI, however only option values will be altered
## and missing options will be added at the end of file; if option
## is not written in this file, but in some file included from it,
## it is NOT counted as missing. Note that all your formatting,
## own comments and so on will be kept as-is.
##
## Obviously, if you don't like what ELinks is going to do with
## this file, you can change it by altering the config.saving_style
## option. Come on, aren't we friendly guys after all?

      ## document.browse.forms.insert_mode [0|1]
      #  The setting for this option affects how key presses are handled when
      #  one selects a text-input form-field. When enabled, one must explicitly
      #  'enter' a selected text-field to edit it; this prevents text fields
      #  from capturing key presses, such as presses of a scroll key, when it is
      #  inadvertently selected. When disabled, key presses are always inserted
      #  into a selected text field.
