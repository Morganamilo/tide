If you wish you can also use the upgrade2gui script to get a GUI mode with better support for images, videos and web browsing.

##Usage

All installed packages are listed in "Void Packages" (dependencies are not listed). You can learn how to use the tools with the Cheatsheet provided. 

There are also a few handy bash commands which you can use for easily setting up an IDE, mounting USB devices, showing battery, system brightness, screenlocking, etc.

Please note that for some of the functionality to work you need the proper names of your system modules, just follow the instructions in the .bashsys file for how to get them.
